    assertEquals is preferred over assertTrue and assertFalse

    When an assertEquals fails, the first and second values are printed in the error report,
    giving better feedback of what went wrong. assertTrue and assertFalse simply report
    failure. Not all testable results fit this but, if possible, use assertEquals.
